# Python-Projects
These are examples of some of my python  projects. I have tried to choose a variety of different types of projects to showcase different areas of python, from the fundamentals to TKinter and selenium

Hangman: Fundamentals - This was an early project to test some of the syntax and features of python, I used it in a python training club to show beginners how some of the conditionals, loops and python methods worked.

TKinter: UI Demo - This is a demo of TKinter that can be expanded upon whenever a project presents itself that requires a UI

QB (Quickbet): Selenium and web automation - This program allowed me to test a theory I had that if you bet all of the money in the betting account on all the obvious winners of football (winning by 2 goals with 2 minutes to go for example) then over time the winnings would compound and make the bets worth it. This proved true for a while but after enough matches there will eventually be an unexpected comeback. However, this was a good project to practice webscraping, web automation and a lot of python features. I also ran it on my raspberry pi which allowed for more experimentation with Linux.
